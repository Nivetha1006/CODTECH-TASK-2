## Overview the project 

### project : 
This project is a temperature conversion program written in C that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin using a menu-based system. It demonstrates the application of arithmetic operations and conditional statements in real-world scenarios.


### Objective 
The objective of this project is to develop a temperature converter program that allows users to convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales using a menu-driven interface. It aims to enhance understanding of temperature conversions and improve programming skills.


### key activites 
- **Designing the Menu Interface:**- Create a user-friendly menu to select various temperature conversion options.
- **Implementing Conversion Formulas:**- Write accurate formulas for converting temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.
- **Input Validation and Error Handling:**- Ensure correct user input and handle invalid menu choices gracefully.
- **Testing and Debugging:**- Test the program with different input values to verify accuracy and fix any issues encountered.


### technique used 
The primary technique used in this project is menu-driven programming, which allows users to interact with the program by selecting predefined options. It utilizes conditional statements (switch-case) for decision-making and arithmetic operations for performing temperature conversions based on user input.
